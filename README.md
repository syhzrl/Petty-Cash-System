# Petty-Cash-System

The Petty Cash System is a system that records and calculate petty cash flow in the company. This is a semi automatic system where staff/users will have to provide input
through Google Forms and the updates will be done automatically. By the end of the month a cash flow summary will be emailed to an Administrator. About 90% of the process in this 
system is automated.
